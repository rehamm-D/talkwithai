### 📦 Project Structure

The architecture of TALKwithAI follows a clean and modular Next.js setup. All page components are organized within the pages/ directory, with index.js serving as the main entry point. Global styling is handled through Tailwind CSS and applied via globals.css located in the styles/ folder. Essential configuration files like tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js are placed at the root level for seamless styling and build integration. Project metadata and scripts (dev, build, start) are defined in package.json, along with all required dependencies including next, react, and react-dom. A well-structured .gitignore ensures unnecessary files (such as node_modules and build artifacts) remain untracked. Since this version of TALKwithAI does not rely on any static assets, the public/ folder has been intentionally excluded. Overall, the codebase is minimal, readable, and fully prepared for scalable deployment on Vercel.
